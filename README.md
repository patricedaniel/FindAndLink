# FindAndLink
InDesign-Script to find domains in a document and set hyperlinks in a efficient way

## Description
The script displays a Find/Link window. Similar to a Find/Change- or Search/Replace function. 
But it searches for domain or URL patterns and proposes an URL to set a Hyperlink on the found text.
In one version a part of the tracking link ist made of the woodwing studio publication and issue.
The script checks first if signed in at one of two supported servers (can be changed below) and checks all articles out.
In the other versionâ€”the tracking infomration can be left empty or be defined at l46/47. It works without Woodwing Studio.

Select Windows > Utilities > Scripts to open the Scripts Panel. If you create or receive a script, you can place it in the Scripts Panel folder, so it shows up in the Scripts panel.
